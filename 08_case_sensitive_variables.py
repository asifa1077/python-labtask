# This code demonstrates that Python variable names are case-sensitive

a = 43013      # Lowercase 'a' is one variable
A = "Asifa Akther Nilyma" # Uppercase 'A' is a different variable

# Print both to see they are treated separately
print(a)    # Output: 43013
print(A)    # Output: Asifa Akther Nilyma
